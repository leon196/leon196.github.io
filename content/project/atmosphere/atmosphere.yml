info:
  - "The project tells the story of the birth of a shared imaginary space by opening the virtual space to the users' bodies through the encounter between the Kinect camera and the mapping. It is part of the work Heterotopia, which explores the spaces that connect us to our utopias."
  - "We play the role of a dreamer lying on his bed. Projected on the ceiling, a giant screen becomes the mirror of a nocturnal imagination in which we see our own body floating in space. Floating in a sky of memories, our body travels through pieces of space and objects belonging to Neon Midnight's memories."
