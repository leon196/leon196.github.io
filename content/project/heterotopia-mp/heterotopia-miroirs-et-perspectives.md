    - Heterotopia Miroires et Perspectives is a multiplayer, participatory virtual reality experience that immerses your body in a field of point clouds. The user is equipped with a VR headset and explores within a designated physical area where viewers can enter and create interactions within the VR space. A Kinect is placed above the play area and records people, elements and the environment. Finally, a video projector projects the virtual space into the real world on a screen visible to the audience.

    - "Interactions are made of multiple layers: the Kinect point cloud space is synchronized with the VR space, the user sees his body in first person view and his brain creates the illusion of reality. The body contacts between the user, the spectators and his environment enhance the illusion of tangibility. Prerecorded point cloud fields can tell a story, arouse curiosity and spread amalgam between what is real or imaginary. The retransmission of the digital space in the environment connects the VR space to the spectators, as they can see themselves in the point cloud field."

    - The idea behind is inspired by the concept of heterotopia described by philosopher Michel Foucault. In general, a heterotopia is a physical representation or approximation of a utopia, or a parallel space. An incompatible, contradictory and transforming space. Worlds within worlds. It is a superposition of layers of realities combined to experiment new sensations, to create new connections between visual cognition and tangible feelings.
