	    <p>I've been part of the Cookie Collective since 2016, when I met Jonathan Giroux, helping him organizing the Cookie Demoparty. Since then I've been involved in the organization of many events, projects and manifestations of the collective. We notably made a "BYOB" (bring your own beamer) in what used to be the Landy Sauvage in 2019. With 16 projectors, we illuminated the walls of a hangar with many differents digital artists. While we were already evolving from demoparty to digital art festival, this was a turning point for the collective. With the pandemic in 2020, there was a hibernation phase, that was awaken by new encounters later in 2021 with musicians practicing live coding. This  new phase triggered our close association with the algorave scene. While we were already performing in Shader Showdown, a shader live coding competition, we blended audio and visual performance under the live coding practice. Today we keep pushing digital art boundaries by bringing many experimental formats, leaning toward something we like to call a digital bazar.</p>
