info:
  - Reflecting a computer tower, the screen facade opens like a portal, inviting the viewer to approach the heart of the machine. The screen and the central processing unit become one. It forms a digital sculpture on which content calculated in real time is displayed. Generated by graphic code, the screen projects fractal animations.
