info:
  - 'In 2023, the <a href="https://www.cookie.paris/">Cookie Collective</a> were invited for live coding performances at <a href="https://2023.amaze-berlin.de/">A MAZE.</a> festival in Berlin. The place had an extra room for an exhibition, so we had the opportunity to make something special. With <a href="https://playful-machines.com/">Emilie Breslavetz</a>, we created a playful and experimental exhibition: the Crash Party. People could play games with alternative controllers and be immerged in a world of errors and bugs. This is where we created Crashboard, our cybersurfing game played with a skateboard.'
