    <p><i>The visual journey through memory, through recollections, is possible in certain situations of hypnosis or dreaming. The work on this film focuses on the capacity of immersive films to evoke the sensation of dreamlike images. How can we visualize what is in the past or the future, in short, what is absent from the present? The film is a journey, a mental itinerary that uses all scales of human perception to depict memory, from the infinitely large to the smallest, invisible detail.</i></p>
