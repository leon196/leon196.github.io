info:
    - Mapping Inversé is part of the “Image Processor” series, which aims to deconstruct the materiality of technology by playing on the scale of each component. The sculpture consists of a screen placed behind the transparent resin print of a Quadro 4000 graphics card. The liquid crystals are concealed behind the technological artefact until the screen's backlighting comes on, revealing each pixel. Floating to the right of the screen, a computer calculates generative animations in real time. Like architectural mapping, the visuals play with the shapes of the graphics card to create the illusion of a collision.
