    - L'Attrape Rêve is a performance and a participatory digital installation.
    - A video and audio work in which the audience is invited to explore the world of dreams. The work is performed by 3 performers. The first is a shaman who invites members of the audience to lie down on a dream table, which allows the body to be scanned and the dream images to be extracted. The second is an illusionist who is responsible for operating the dream channels captured by the scanner. He manages the frequencies emitted by the lying body and transcribes them on the screen, the dome. The third is a musician who creates the narration and accompanies the audience with a sound ambiance and spoken texts that guide people on their journey.
