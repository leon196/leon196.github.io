    <p><i>Heterotopia is a VR experience that immerses your body into a participative live point cloud field. The user is equipped with a VR headset and is exploring inside a designated physical area where spectators can enter and create interactions inside the VR space. A Kinect is placed on top of the playing area and records people, elements and environment. Finally, a video projector is screening the virtual space in the real world, with video mapping on frames depicting paintings of different perspectives.</i></p>

    <p>Interactions are made of multiple layers: the Kinect point cloud space is synchronized with the VR space, the user sees his body in first person view and his brain creates the illusion of reality. The body contacts between the user, the spectators and his environment enhance the illusion of tangibility. Prerecorded point cloud fields can tell a story, arouse curiosity and spread amalgam between what is real or imaginary. The retransmission of the digital space in the environment connects the VR space to the spectators, as they can see themselves in the point cloud field.</p>

    <p>The idea behind is inspired by the concept of heterotopia described by philosopher Michel Foucault. In general, a heterotopia is a physical representation or approximation of a utopia, or a parallel space. An incompatible, contradictory and transforming space. Worlds within worlds. It is a superposition of layers of realities combined to experiment new sensations, to create new connections between visual cognition and tangible feelings.</p>
