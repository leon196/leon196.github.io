    - <i>You no longer know what day it is, you're always looking for your glasses and you've forgotten your daughter's name. You decide to dust off the memories that have been left abandoned in your house, in the hope of covering up the grey areas. But is it really necessary to remember everything?</i>
    - "In Dusted, the user explores fragmented memories, thrust into a quest to rebuild identity. This journey is woven into the project through vibrant aesthetics and dynamic interactions enabled by Kinect technology: gestures triggers a swirl of particles, fragments of memory rising and vanishing in a visual explosion."
