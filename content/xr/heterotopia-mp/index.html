			<h1>Heterotopia, Miroirs et Perspectives</h1>
			<h2>immersive point cloud</h2>
			<p>Heterotopia is a 15-minute VR experience for one participant exploring imaginary places, their creation, sharing, and disappearance.</p>
			<p>Children, writers, and many others wander through places they construct according to their imagination. We want to open the door to this world by offering an adaptation of a collection of letters from two architects imagining a place, Chamber for a Memory Palace.</p>
			<p>To give form to this immaterial concept, the experience takes the form of a model of a fantastical city built with real buildings. It is made possible by an innovative system that combines VR, Kinect, and photogrammetry. This system offers a level of interaction that allows the participant to raise and lower buildings at will with their fingertips, interactively recreating the demiurgic feeling of creation.</p>
			<p>Using a Kinect to provide detailed information about the exhibition space, the participant is immersed in an environment similar to their own. The VR headset adds an object to their reality: an architect's table. Thanks to the dust on the table, they can build an entire city on a 3D scale. But the experience extends beyond the table itself: the participant invites their creation to spill over its frame and invade the real world around them.</p>
