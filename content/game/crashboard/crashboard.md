    - Crashboard is a surfing cyberspace game controlled by a real skateboard. In the game, you have to avoid waves of operating system windows pop-up interface scrolling in your direction while catching GIFs coming from the retro GeoCities web hosting service. You control the player position by leaning on the skateboard. The aesthetic of the game is crafted from glitch, retro web design and error system.
