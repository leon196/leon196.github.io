info:
    - Crashboard is a surfing cyberspace game controlled by a skateboard.
    - It is the first game of my collaboration with <a href="https://playful-machines.com/">Emilie Breslavetz</a> which emerge from the first <a href="/content/project/crash-party/">Crash Party</a> in 2023. From it's first prototype to it's final form today, Crashboard is a tribute to the early imagination of cyberspace culture.
