    - "GPU is a puzzle game-installation that challenges players to interact with their own distorted reflections. Using a custom enigmatic gamepad, players navigate the feedback of a live camera feed displayed on a screen. The screen shows two versions of their image: one is clear and unaltered, while the other is glitched and transformed by video effects. Manipulate the cryptic controller to match the altered image, exploring and decoding the controller's functions to solve the puzzle. Can you decipher the glitches and perfect your digital double?"
